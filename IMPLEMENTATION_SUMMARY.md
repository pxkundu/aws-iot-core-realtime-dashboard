## 🔧 **AWS Services Used**

### **Existing Resources (Preserved)**
- ✅ **Amplify Backend**: Authentication and user management
- ✅ **Location Service**: Maps, geofences, trackers
- ✅ **IoT Core**: Device messaging and management
- ✅ **Pinpoint**: Analytics and user engagement

### **New Resources (Added)**
- ✅ **DynamoDB**: Device and assignment data storage
- ✅ **SNS**: Notification topic for alerts
- ✅ **SES**: Email delivery service
- ✅ **Lambda**: Email processing and geofence monitoring
- ✅ **CDK**: Infrastructure as code for custom resources

## 🎯 **User Workflow**

### **1. User Registration**
```
User visits dashboard → Signs up with email/password → 
User profile created → Access to core features
```

### **2. Device Management**
```
User creates device → Enters device details and location → 
Device stored in DynamoDB → Device appears in device list
```

### **3. Geofence Creation**
```
User creates geofence → Defines polygon coordinates → 
Geofence created in Location Service → Metadata stored in DynamoDB
```

### **4. Device Assignment**
```
User selects device and geofence → Creates assignment → 
Assignment stored in DynamoDB → Device monitored for geofence breaches
```

### **5. Notification System**
```
Device location update → Geofence evaluation → 
Breach detected → SNS notification → Email sent to user
```
